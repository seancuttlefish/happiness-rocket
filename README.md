# Happiness Rocket
 
 The Happiness Rocket is a modular rocket that you can 3D print and install a BBC Micro:bit inside.
 
 See https://www.interactdigitalarts.uk/projects/happiness-rocket
 
 This repository contains the STL files to print and a simple program to run on the Micto:bit.

 The program expects a chain of 10 NeoPixels to be installed on pin 2 of the Micro:bit. To install the program, drag-and-drop the .hex file on to your Micro:bit, or open it in the MakeCode Editor and install/edit from there.

 When you press the A button the colour changes, when you press the B button the brightness changes.

 If you install the program on a second Micro:bit it will act as a remote control for the rocket - changing the colours remotely when you press the buttons.
