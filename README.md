# HappinessRocket
 
 The Happiness Rocket is a modular rocket that that your can 3D print and install a BBC Micro:bit in to.

 This repository contains the STL files to print the rocket and a simple program to run on the Micto:bit.

 The program expects a chain of 10 NeoPixels to be installed on pin 2 of the Micro:bit. To install, drag-and-drop on to your Micro:bit, or open it in the MakeCode Editor and install from there.

 When you press the A button the colour changes, when you press the B button the brightness changes.

 If you install the program on a second Micro:bit it will act as a remote control - changing the rocket's colours when you press the buttons.
